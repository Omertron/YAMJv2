# Yet Another Movie Jukebox (YAMJ)
YAMJ is a command line tool used to create a jukebox for your locally stored video files.
This jukebox can either be saved as a HTML format or ActionScript (flash).

Primarily this jukebox is aimed at the [Cloud Media](http://cloudmedia.com) players, but it has been sucessfully used with other players too.

YAMJ supports many different sources of data, such as TheMovieDB, TheTVDB, Allocine, etc. and therefore many different languages.

# Note: This application is no longer supported, and fixes are unlikely to be created for any issues new or existing.

There is a massive community supporting user created skins that allow for the complete customization of the jukebox.
