==============================

Saxon-HE 9.6 is the latest major release of the open-source edition of Saxon.
It is available for the Java platform (.NET platform coming shortly).

The current maintenance release is Saxon-HE 9.6.0.4.

The documentation for Saxon is at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/
and includes a detailed list of changes for each release.

For the Java platform, download file SaxonHE9-9-0-4J.zip. Installation instructions are at:

http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!about/installationjava

The file saxon-resources9-6.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous resources.
It is common to both platforms, and is not normally updated when new maintenance releases appear.

The file saxon9-6-0-4source.zip contains source code for both platforms; a new version is produced with each
maintenance release. Source code with the latest patches can also be obtained from a Subversion repository
maintained at https://dev.saxonica.com/repos/archive/opensource. The Subversion repository on the SourceForge site is no longer maintained.

The following bugs are cleared in 9.6.0.4, issued 2015-01-14 (this includes bugs that appear only in the commercial
versions of the product). Bugs are listed under the number used on the new Saxonica Community site at
