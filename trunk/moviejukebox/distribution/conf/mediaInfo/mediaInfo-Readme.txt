Place the MediaInfo executable in this directory

Download the MediaInfo program (Command Line Interface version) from here: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86862&package_id=90612
Ensure you get a version that has an EXE file.
Install MediaInfo into this directory

If you want to use mediainfo-rar (from http://www.lundman.net/wiki/index.php/Mediainfo-rar)
Just unpack the files into this directory also.
It will automatically be picked up used instead of the standard mediainfo
